Up until the late 16th century, there has been little known as to why moving bodies accelerated or decelerated. Most people assumed that objects fell downwards or drifted upwards due to some unknown, innate quality. However, this began to change with the advent of the Scientific Revolution, when scientists discovered that various factors, including friction, air resistance, and gravity, are responsible for changing the velocity of a moving item.

Nicolaus Copernicus, a Polish astronomer, published his theory in 1543 that the Earth was not the center of the Solar system, but that it, along with the other planets, orbited around the Sun in a “heliocentric” system. Johannes Kepler, a German astronomer, developed his laws of planetary motion between 1609 and 1619, which explain the shape and speed of planet orbits. Later, in the 1630s, Galileo disputed Aristotle’s beliefs on falling objects, proving that an unleashed arrow continues to fly due to inertia, and shows how a sliding book comes to a halt because of friction.

These scientists created the foundation for French philosopher Rene Descartes and German polymath Gottfried Leibniz to develop their own theories on motion, and for English physicist Isaac Newton to tie everything together in his publishing: _Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica_ (Principia).

### Newton's first law:

> An object at rest remains at rest, and an object in motion remains in motion at constant speed and in a straight line unless acted on by an unbalanced force.

Newton's first law of motion, known as the law of inertia, states that an object at rest remains at rest and an object in motion continues in motion with the same velocity until acted on by an external force. For example, when the breaks on a car are applied, the car will quickly come to a stop. However, as the passengers are not acted upon by the same force, they will be flung thrown towards the front of the vehicle.

Newton's law enabled accurate predictions of motion for the first time. Force is described as a push or pull put on an object and is measured in Newtons (represented by N, where 1N is the force necessary to accelerate a 1kg mass by 1 m/s²). If the strength of all the forces acting on an object is known, the net external force (the sum of the external forces) can be expressed as \\(\Sigma F\\).

### Newton's second law:

> The acceleration of an object depends on the mass of the object and the amount of force applied.

Newton's second law, also known as the law of force and acceleration, is one of the most important in physics. It states that the rate of change of a body's momentum is proportional to the applied force and occurs in the direction of the force.

This can be expressed as \\(\Sigma F=ma\\), where \\(\Sigma F\\) is the net force, \\(m\\) is the object’s mass, and \\(a\\) is the acceleration of the object in the direction of the net force. Thus, acceleration increases as force increases. Furthermore, the acceleration is inversely proportional to the object's mass, so if mass increases, acceleration decreases. This can be expressed as \\(a=\frac{\Sigma F}{m}\\). For example, as a rocket uses up fuel during its flight, its mass decreases, therefore causing it to accelerate at an ever-increasing rate.

### Newton's third law:

> Whenever one object exerts a force on another object, the second object exerts an equal and opposite on the first.

According to Newton's third law, every action has an equal and opposite reaction. When a person sits down, he or she exerts a downward force on the chair, which in turn exerts an equal upward force on the person's body. One force is known as the action, while the other is known as the reaction.

For example, due to the opposing forces of such an action-reaction pair, a rifle recoils after it has been shot. When the trigger on the rifle is released, a gunpowder explosion produces hot gases that expand outwards, allowing the weapon to propel the bullet forwards. As stated by Newton’s third law, this also causes the bullet to push backwards on the rifle.

The force acting on both the rifle and the bullet is the same, but as acceleration is proportional to force and mass (as stated by Newton's second law), the rifle experiences a far lower recoil acceleration due to its higher mass.

> There is neither more nor less power in an effect than there is in its cause. - Gottfried Leibniz

### From Newton to Einstein

Newton maintained that space and time are things in their own right, which exist independently of matter. However, centuries later, Einstein set out to develop a more universal theory of motion, which he published in his report, _General Theory of Relativity,_ in 1916. While Newton's laws of motion are generally true for macroscopic objects (things visible to the human eye), they fail at very high speeds, at very small scales, and under very strong gravitational fields.
