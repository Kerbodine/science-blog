An object is in free-fall when gravity is the only force that acts upon it (Air resistance can be ignored).

Aristotle, an ancient Greek philosopher, felt that the downwards motion of objects thrown from a great height was because of their tendency to travel towards the center of the Earth, which was supposed to be their “natural home”. From Aristotle’s time until the Middle Ages, it was presumed that the velocity of a free-falling body was directly proportional to its weight and inversely proportional to the density of the medium through which it was falling. Therefore, if two objects of different weights are dropped, the heavier object would fall faster and thus hit the ground first.

In some time between 1589 and 1592, Galileo conducted an experiment by dropping objects from the Tower of Pisa. He observed that when two balls of differing weights were dropped, they always impacted the ground at the same time, directly contradicting Aristotle’s notion of free falling objects.

### Velocity of free-falling objects:

Another concept that Aristotle believed was that free-falling objects had a fixed velocity at which they would fall at, neither accelerating nor decelerating. From 1603, Galileo challenged this concept by attempting to quantify the acceleration of falling objects. However, as the technology of the time wasn’t sufficient to collect data over precise intervals, Galileo had to use a different strategy.

His plan instead was to slow down the overall free-falling motion by placing balls on a ramp, instead of dropping them straight down. By using a water clock to time each interval and marking the distance it took, the results would be a lot more accurate, while still maintaining the correct relationship between the distance traveled and its velocity. Based on the data collected, he found that if he doubled the interval, the measured distance would be four times as far. Hence, he concluded that the distance is proportional to the elapsed time squared.

### Calculating the Earth’s gravitational acceleration:

Despite Galileo’s works, in the 1640s-50s, Giovanni Riccioli and Francesco Grimaldi conducted more investigations in Bologna. At the heart of their experiments was the use of time-keeping pendulums, which were more precise than the water clocks used by Galileo. Because of this, they not only verified Galileo’s discoveries, but also worked out the gravitational acceleration of the Earth to be around \\(9.36(±0.22) m/s^2\\). This figure is only about 5% less than our current figure, which is around \\(9.81 m/s^2\\).

### The hammer and the feather:

In 1971, Apollo 15 astronaut David Scott recreated the famous free-fall experiment on the surface of the Moon. At the end of the mission, he dropped a 1.32kg hammer and a 0.03kg feather at the same time. Without air resistance, both objects fell at exactly the same speed, further confirming Galileo’s theory that all objects accelerate at a uniform rate regardless of its mass. This spectacle was filmed and broadcasted live on TV, which was witnessed by millions worldwide.

### Equations:

If the gravitational acceleration of an object is represented by \\(g\\), the height at which it is released from as \\(z_0\\) and the time taken as \\(t\\), then at any point of the free-fall, the height from the surface is equal to \\(z=z_0-\frac{1}{2}gt^2\\). A body with mass \\(m\\) at a height of \\(z_0\\) also must possess gravitational potential energy, represented by \\(U\\), where \\(U=mgz_0\\).
